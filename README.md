# Sphinx Install Guide

At a previous employer I was asked to find and evaluate several solutions to replace our existing knowledge base platform, which was basically an afterthought tacked on to the ticket system we used for support requests. 

One of the solutions I looked at was [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html "Sphinx Documentation Generator"), a documentation generator written in Python. I found it very poorly documented and difficult to install, and so moved on to other potential solutions. However, I really wanted to take a closer look at Sphinx, so after working through the instructions found from various sources online, I was able to get a working install. Several people on a technical writer mailing list Iâ€™m on asked about the instructions, so I created an install guide they could use themselves to get started. 

**Note** - this was written using a less formal tone that a conventional user guide or install guide, because I was writing for people of a similar skill level and who wanted a quick overview, not a detailed reference guide.
